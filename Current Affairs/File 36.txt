				We define corruption as the abuse of entrusted power for private gain.Corruption erodes trust, weakens democracy, hampers economic development and further exacerbates inequality, poverty, social division and the environmental crisis.Exposing corruption and holding the corrupt to account can only happen if we understand the way corruption works and the systems that enable it.What is corruption?

Corruption can take many forms, and can include behaviours like:Corruption can happen anywhere: in business, government, the courts, the media, and in civil society, as well as across all sectors from health and education to infrastructure and sports.Corruption can involve anyone: politicians, government officials, public servants, business people or members of the public. Corruption happens in the shadows, often with the help of professional enablers such as bankers, lawyers, accountants and real estate agents, opaque financial systems and anonymous shell companies that allow corruption schemes to flourish and the corrupt to launder and hide their illicit wealth.Corruption adapts to different contexts and changing circumstances. It can evolve in response to changes in rules, legislation and even technology.See our anti-corruption glossary for more examples of corrupt behaviourYour freedom and rule of law.Your participation and even your trust in government.Your chance for a healthy environment and a sustainable future.Your opportunity to build and grow wealth.Transparency is all about knowing who, why, what, how and how much. It means shedding light on formal and informal rules, plans, processes and actions. Transparency helps us, the public, hold all power to account for the common good. Seeking and receiving information is a human right that can act as a safeguard against corruption, and increase trust in decision makers and public institutions. However, transparency is not only about making information available, but ensuring it can be easily accessed, understood and used by citizens.We have learned from over twenty-five years of experience that corruption can only be kept in check if representatives from government, business and civil society work together for the common good.See our Strategy to know how Transparency International is working across society to enhance accountability and integrityThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.
