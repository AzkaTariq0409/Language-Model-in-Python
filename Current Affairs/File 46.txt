By understanding the causes of workplace dishonesty, an employer can develop policies to combat it.The company allows and even perpetuates dishonesty by not taking a strong stance against it. To dissuade workplace dishonesty there must be comprehensive policies outlining what dishonesty is and the consequences for employees who violate those policies. The company management and ownership must be vigilant in enforcing these policies to create a culture that shuns dishonesty.Dishonesty in the workplace can be a cause of low morale, but it can also be triggered by an existing atmosphere of employee dissatisfaction as well. Employees who are dissatisfied with their jobs, the company management or conditions in the workplace may engage in employee theft, misrepresentation of work hours on their time sheets and slowing down production, according to Justin A. Walsh, writing on the International Foundation for Protection Officers website. Addressing morale issues can help deter workplace dishonesty.A company that doesn't have a checks and balances system on its account books or an accurate inventory system can become a victim of dishonesty in the workplace. If employees don't fear being caught, then the idea of stealing money or supplies from the company can linger among the staff. Create a series of checks on all accounting entries, petty cash receipts and inventory systems to monitor activity and prevent dishonesty.Employees who believe they're underpaid may feel inclined to steal from the company or pad time sheet hours to add to their income.
