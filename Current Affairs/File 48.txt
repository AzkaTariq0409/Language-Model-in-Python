It takes many forms and manifestations.Often, this breach of ethics happens on an organization-wide scale, where an entire business promotes, supports or condones coverups, falsification, or fact-twisting. More often, dishonesty is simply personal misrepresentation. It includes outright lies, skewing of facts, and failure to communicate truth.From ancient times until today honesty has been upheld as a virtue, and dishonesty widely considered as a negative character quality. The Ten Commandments of Judeo-Christian heritage gives prime importance to the place of honesty with its well-known statement, âYou shall not bear false witnessâ (Exodus 20:16).Regardless of oneâs religious preferences or cultural background, we all know innately that dishonesty is wrong.Itâs time to exercise business ethics that align with our values.Dishonesty results in disaster. At times, such disaster can be averted. Sometimes, dishonesty causes only small ripples.

Many people hear of and suffer from one personâs dishonesty.Here are some of the tragic effects of dishonesty.The whole idea behind dishonesty is making yourself out to be someone youâre not.Trying to live out this nonexistent persona is extremely difficult. It can create severe personal anxiety, psychological problems, and a general sense of mistrust. People have a hard time trusting those who seem artificial.The Bible draws a clear connection between honesty and wellbeing, in this statement from 1 Peter 3:12-12:If you want to âlove lifeâ and âsee good days,â you are required to be honest. A false identity leads to alienation from friends and loved ones. Eventually, a life of falsehood, alienates you from yourself.Lies beget lies. In order to validate a lie that you  told, you have to tell another lie. In order to make that lie seem feasible, you have to tell two more lies. In order to make those lies seem believable, you have to tell even more lies.Such webs of deception are totally unmanageable, no matter how smart you are. In the realm of business, things get unwieldy fast. From paper trails to email threads, itâs impossible to validate all your falsehoods and corroborate all your lies.If you want to plunge your life into a spiral of dark complexity and inextricable terror, then dishonesty will take you there.Edson Spencer, the former chairman of Honeywell Inc., said this,Heâs right.

Rather than building a business empire with sound practices and strong ethics, they turned their companies into global laughingstocks, plunged millions into financial ruin, and ended up serving prison time for their lack of ethics.Needless to say, their reputations are pretty much trashed. In the Bibleâs book of wisdom, Proverbs, the ancient king Solomon renowned for his wisdom made this observation:Experience and inspiration showed him that integrity leads to a life of guidance and control. But âcrookedness,â or lack of integrity, creates destruction. It doesnât take a theologian to acknowledge the truth of that statement.It's hard to recover from a ruined reputationThe antidote to dishonesty, of course, is honesty.But honesty is easier said than done. In order to truly live a life of integrity, we need to have a firm belief that honesty is indeed the best policy. This belief must go beyond platitude and truism, and become part of the fabric of our character.Most business leaders realize, often in retrospect, that honesty should be the guiding principle of their business practice. Jordan Belfort, the notorious Wolf of Wall Street, lived a dream or riches that was founded upon dishonest business. After the house of cards came crashing down, after he lost it all, after he ended up in a federal prison, he wrote this:He was rich.

But in the end, he simply wanted his life to be a huge caution sign.Alan Horn, the chairman of Walt Disney Studios, in a recent interview with Bloomberg  offered these six words as a summary of his ethic: âNever lie to anyone about anything.âHonesty must be a rooted ethic, something that advises us every time we open our mouths, turn on our computers, 0r make a decision.
