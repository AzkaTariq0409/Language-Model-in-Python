MenuSARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes COVID-19. The spike protein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 is an example of an antigen.Vaccines are the best way to train our immune system to recognize viruses, or pieces of viruses, called antigens. Our immune system creates antibodies and other defenses to protect us.When a vaccinated person is exposed to SARS-CoV-2, their immune system will recognize the viral antigens and spring into action to keep them healthy. There are many different types of vaccines, as seen in the diagram above.All vaccine platforms are designed to train our immune system. There are two categories of COVID-19 Vaccines: Component Viral Vaccines and Whole Virus Vaccines.Â© 2022 VIPER Group COVID19 Vaccine Tracker TeamFunding provided by the McGill University Interdisciplinary Initiative in Infection and Immunity (MI4)This site is provided for informational purposes only based on publically available data.Site Credits | Website Feedback Form
