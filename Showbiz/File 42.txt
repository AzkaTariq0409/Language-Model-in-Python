Lollywood (Punjabi and Urdu: لالی وُڈ lâli vuḍ) refers to the Pakistani Urdu and Punjabi-language[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10] film industry based in Lahore.[11] Since the partition of India in 1947, Lahore has been the center of Pakistani cinema, with films being produced both in Urdu and Punjabi. The word "Lollywood" is a portmanteau of "Lahore" and "Hollywood", coined in 1989 by Glamour magazine gossip columnist Saleem Nasir, and is usually used comparatively with respect to other industries in South Asian cinema, such as Tollywood and Bollywood. 
Prior to 2007, Lahore was the most prolific producer of Urdu films, before being largely overtaken by Karachi.
"Lollywood" is a portmanteau derived from Lahore and "Hollywood", a shorthand reference for the American film industry, Hollywood.
Lollywood films in Punjabi were most popular in the 1960s and are often referred to as the golden age of Pakistani Punjabi cinema.[12]
