In the era of media and digitalization, Pakistan’s entertainment industry is still rising from the ashes. Despite decades of severe debacles, it appears that we have little idea of how to do things differently that can match the international benchmarks. We always like rehashing and rebranding sparkless concepts, only to later lament our fundamental lack of promise in the long run. The issue is the lack of a meticulous approach that can transform the industry to execute projects in the right direction. Although we have seen some movies lately that ruled the box office and shattered many records, the problem lies in living up to the expectations consistently. If the filmmakers agree to do something out of the ordinary then it would provide people reasons to return to theatres every month, not just during some holidays. Although being overshadowed by international cinema, a loose script, and screen failures, the Pakistani cinema, and the drama industry has seen tremendous development during this decade. Young Pakistani actors have not only altered the film business through their on-screen presence but they have also created an instant impact to get the eyes of the Pakistani audience. New Filmmakers are attempting to change the paradigms of theatre to match the projections of global standards. Previously, we have seen our cinema being brutally bashed by following the same cliche story revolving around a macho man and his several affairs or portraying enough of family politicals. To eliminate this, the young generation of actors are working hard towards creating a distinctive identity, by not following the same old school pattern and experimenting more. Most people in Pakistan are attracted to Netflix and other entertainment portals due to the lack of trust they put in their own film industry. More Pakistanis than ever before are watching the latest movies, seasons, and web series that make the headlines worldwide. Films are released throughout the year around different parts of the world, notably around public and national holidays. People of all ages crave this type of liberty here and they want to go to the theatres to see as many Pakistani films as they do other international blockbusters. They demand substantial-quality screenplays that can become the talk of the town. Another formidable obstacle that creates hindrance towards a better cinema is often many young and energetic actors sees the drama industry as the ultimate stairs towards success and fame.  They prefer to showcase their skills in dramas because they offer a relatively better script and spark breakthroughs for them to become public figures. There is a dire need for talented directors and producers to step up and provide a platform that can appreciate their contribution by offering them good films. Only then, we would be able to create healthy competition in the industry. It would also open a gateway for future collaboration with Bollywood or Hollywood so our cinema workforce can get enough exposure to start thinking more realistically to stupefy the audience more and paving the way to compete internationally - maybe Oscars?
