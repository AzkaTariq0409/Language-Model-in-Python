Overtime RulesOvertime will only be played during the playoffs. In the event of a tie at the end of regulation, there will be two sudden death overtime periods played, with a shootout if no team scores. Golden Goal Overtime: In the first overtime period there will be a 1:00 minute running clock and teams will play 4v4 (3 skaters and 1 goalie). If no goal is scored in this time period, the clock is then reset and 1 skater is removed from the ice for a 3v3 1:00 minute period. If neither team scores in these overtime periods, a shootout will then take place.Shootout: Each team selects their three shooters. These three are the team's shooters for the remainder of the overtime. Each team will take turns alternating shooting at the opposing goalie. A coin toss or RPS will determine choice of either defending or shooting first. Once shooters and the starting position is established the team who is shooting first will send out their first player to make their attempt. Once that player makes their attempt, successful or not, the goalies will switch positions in the net and the opposing team will send out their first player. This will continue until both teams have cycled through their selected shooters. In the event that the score is still tied after the first round of shoot-out, the order of shooters is reversed and three more attempts per team are taken.
