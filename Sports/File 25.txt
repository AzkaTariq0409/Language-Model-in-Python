Lahore Qalandars are a side many like making fun of. After all, it is the only franchise without a Pakistan Super League title. When a rival fan asks about their titles, Qalandar fans are obliged to mention their (excellent) Player Development Program and its products, such as Haris Rauf, as “bigger than titles.” However, when it comes to PSL season, each fan wants their team to win, and Lahore is no different.Just over halfway through PSL 6, the optimism in the Qalandars camp would have been high. Finalists in PSL 5 and on the verge of qualifying for the playoffs for PSL 6, it looked like the days of first-round knockouts were finally over. Yet, needing just one win in their last four games, the Qalandars proceeded to lose 4/4 before being knocked out on net run-rate, although they avoided the ignominious last position in the points table.With PSL season back upon us, the Qalandars are back, with one major change. With Shaheen Shah Afridi’s stock on the rise, the Qalandars management finally decided to demote Sohail Akhtar from the captaincy role, with the speedster taking over. Aaqib Javed continues as the Head Coach. At the draft, the Qalandars made some interesting picks, beefing up their squad and choosing some lower-profile overseas selections.Ahead of the draft, the Qalandars named their retentions after much deliberation. Shaheen Shah Afridi, Rashid Khan, David Wiese, Haris Rauf, Mohammad Hafeez, Sohail Akhtar, Zeeshan Ashraf, and Ahmed Daniyal – but there was one big miss in Fakhar Zaman. Initially, people thought that the Qalandars had given up on their trusted left-hander, but soon a few hints on social media made it clear that he would be making a return to the franchise.Sure enough, Lahore Qalandars had the first pick at the draft in the Platinum category, and they picked up Fakhar Zaman right away. With the rest of their Platinum and Diamond picks sorted, they made some big moves in Gold, shoring up their batting order with the additions of Abdullah Shafique, Phil Salt, and Harry Brook. In Silver, they picked up local star Kamran Ghulam alongside little-known New Zealander Dean Foxcroft.The Qalandars had the first pick in the Emerging category, and they promptly selected 20-year-old Kashmiri pacer Zaman Khan, a hot commodity at the draft. With their second Emerging pick, they opted for the familiarity of leg-spinner Maaz Khan. Another familiar face followed in the Supplementary round, with the return of all-rounder Samit Patel. Their final pick was the PDP product and left-arm wrist-spinner, Syed Faridoun.With partial availability coming into play due to England’s tour of the West Indies, the Qalandars later picked up Ben Dunk (for Phil Salt) and Matthew Potts (for Harry Brook) as partial replacements. With their other two Supplementary picks, the Qalandars opted for the all-round option in Imran Randhawa alongside the left-arm pace of Akif Javed.Top-orderMiddle-orderAll-roundersFast-bowlersSpinnersFakhar ZamanFakhar ZamanDavid WieseShaheen Shah AfridiRashid KhanMohammad HafeezMohammad HafeezMohammad HafeezDavid WieseMohammad HafeezAbdullah ShafiqueHarry BrookKamran GhulamHaris RaufKamran GhulamPhil SaltSohail AkhtarSamit PatelAhmed DaniyalMaaz KhanSohail AkhtarKamran GhulamImran RandhawaZaman KhanSamit PatelZeeshan AshrafDean FoxcroftImran RandhawaSyed FaridounKamran GhulamSamit PatelAkif JavedBen DunkMatthew PottsImran RandhawaLahore Qalandars have often struggled with a stable batting order, making some curious choices for top-order anchors and aggressors. Fakhar Zaman has been the only real constant in their top-order. However, they have made some more pragmatic choices for PSL 7, meaning their top order looks fairly strong, a much-needed turnaround after the PSL 6 disaster. Despite his past struggles in the PSL, Phil Salt is a top pace-hitting powerplay option (PP SR 160+ against pace since 2020). Meanwhile, Abdullah Shafique is likely to provide more stability in an anchor-type role at the top.Batting Teams in the Powerplay in PSL 6TeamAvgRPOMultan Sultans57.68.8Karachi Kings33.17.5Peshawar Zalmi29.97.7Quetta Gladiators28.57.1Islamabad United27.39.1Lahore Qalandars19.66.5The Qalandars’ bowling attack doesn’t require much praise. The names speak for themselves. In Shaheen Shah Afridi, Haris Rauf, and Rashid Khan, Lahore have three of the world’s best T20 bowlers together in one side, with all of them complementing each other superbly. They are the three top wicket-takers in T20s over the last couple of years (with Samit Patel not far down that list) and will be ably assisted by emerging pacer Zaman Khan. With these four bowlers likely to start for the Qalandars if everyone is fit and available, the Shaheen Shah Afridi-led side have most of their bases covered, with various options for all phases.Most Wickets in T20s Since 2020BowlerWicketsAvgEconRashid Khan14118.06.5Haris Rauf11122.68.5Shaheen Shah Afridi10321.17.7Mustafizur Rahman9717.97.3Wahab Riaz8522.88.4Adam Zampa8221.37.4Imran Tahir8018.36.7Samit Patel8023.17.2Mujeeb Ur Rahman7921.16.6Chris Jordan7931.78.7With Mohammad Hafeez, David Wiese, and Samit Patel continuing to be a part of the franchise, alongside the additions of Kamran Ghulam and Imran Randhawa, Lahore Qalandars have ensured that fielding a balanced lineup is unlikely to be a problem for them in PSL 7. Kamran Ghulam offers a local alternative to Samit Patel, also batting right-handed and bowling left-arm spin, though perhaps without the guile or consistency of the veteran. Imran Randhawa can hit a long ball and contribute a couple of overs of pace, similar to David Wiese.With COVID always a looming threat, one of the most important factors for teams is how strong their depth is. While Lahore Qalandars have an incredible first-choice bowling attack, any injury or enforced absence to one or two of their main bowling options will see them having to resort to a host of young and inexperienced bowlers. Among frontline pacers, Ahmed Daniyal and Akif Javed are likely to be the backup for the trio of Shaheen/Haris/Zaman, while Rashid Khan’s backup is the emerging duo of Maaz Khan and Syed Faridoun besides the all-rounders.Lahore Qalandars’ Backup Bowling OptionsPlayerAgesT20sAhmed Daniyal2413Akif Javed2128Matthew Potts2340Maaz Khan216Syed Faridoun201One recurring concern that Qalandars’ fans have had over the years is their strategies and tactics. With much of the team management being the same, that may be something to keep an eye on over the course of the season. It will also be interesting to see how Shaheen Shah Afridi, being a captain at the tender age of 21, carries himself and his team in pressure moments. He has repeatedly shown he’s up for the challenge with the ball. Can he replicate that touch with the captain’s armband?Lahore Qalandars had the first pick in the emerging category, and they immediately picked up Zaman Khan. A 20-year-old pacer from Kashmir, Zaman plays for Northern in the domestic circuit and caught the eye in the past few months. He initially took part in the televised Kashmir Premier League and then participated in the National T20 Cup. He was the 4th-highest wicket-taker in the KPL with 10 wickets @ 17.8 (econ 7.7), while he picked up 6 wickets @ 22.8 (econ 8.1) in the NT20. The 5’11-tall speedster can bowl 140kph+ and sees Shoaib Akhtar as a role model, although his action is fairly similar to Lasith Malinga. He also possesses a good skill set, able to bowl with the new and old ball.The Qalandars’ second emerging pick was Maaz Khan, a familiar face who has been with the franchise for several seasons. He last represented the franchise in their PSL 5 campaign, with the highlight being his dismissal of Babar Azam in the Kings-Qalandars derby. Maaz also played some domestic cricket for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa this season and was often spotted alongside the main squads, indicating that the young leggie is being groomed for the future. He played for the KP 2nd XI in the 3-Day 2nd XI tournament, where he registered a match haul of 9/155 against Northern and almost bowled his side to victory. With very few leg-spinners participating in the tournament, his tally of 18 wickets @ 26.7 stood out.In the supplementary picks, the Qalandars picked up Syed Faridoun as their third emerging option. The youngster, a 20-year-old left-arm wrist-spinner, is another product of the Lahore Qalandars Player Development Program. Consequently, he was signed up by the Melbourne Stars for BBL 11 and made his debut in Australia. Initially a finger-spinner, the bespectacled talent switched to wrist-spin after feedback from Lahore Qalandars’ Head Coach Aaqib Javed. The Qalandars’ coach also stated that Rashid Khan had been impressed by Faridoun, saying that he would be “Pakistan’s best bowler in three years.”With the entire squad available, this looks like Qalandars’ strongest playing XI. However, the English duo of Phil Salt and Harry Brook will not be available initially, meaning that the likes of Ben Dunk and Samit Patel could come into the playing XI. It will be interesting to see how the Qalandars manage their middle-order resources. When Brook is available, he could be a crucial component of Qalandars’ middle-order batting, positioned anywhere between #4 and #6, with his death overs strike rate of 200+. The likes of Sohail Akhtar could also come into the picture, depending on the tactics they opt to employ.Someone or the other always has the feeling that this could be the Qalandars’ year. After all, they will eventually win it some time, right? It’s likely to be a matter of when rather than if. And with the ICC Cricketer of the Year at the helm along with a fairly solid squad on paper, PSL 7 might just be the time it all comes together for the Qalandars. Alternatively, it could all go pear-shaped once again, but with the squad they have, it would be surprising if the Qalandars had a poor season – of course, with the caveat of COVID playing spoiler. Ultimately, a strong showing from Lahore Qalandars will be good for the league.
