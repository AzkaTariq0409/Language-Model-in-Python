AIFF Media TeamNEW DELHI: Indian Footballers took a stand on
the International Day for Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation, stating
that the malpractice needs to come to an end to give an equal chance to
children.Female
genital mutilation is an ancient practice that is still followed across many
places in the world, including certain regions in India as well.‚ÄúWomen in
our society have grown a lot, and have gone on to do great things. But the dark
underbelly of such backward practices as genital mutilation for girls still
exists. Such practices tend to take away the individuality and self-confidence
out of such children,‚Äù said former Indian Women‚Äôs Team captain Oinam Bembem
Devi.‚ÄúAs a
society, we should condemn such practices and make sure that every child in our
country has a proper childhood with decent education, and that they have the
opportunity to grow up and become what they want to. Only then can we progress
as a nation,‚Äù the ‚ÄòDurga of Indian Football‚Äô further stated.On the International Day of Zero Tolerance for #FGM, our #IndianFootball ‚öΩ stars have a message for everyone üôå#EndFGM #BackTheBlue #IndianFootballForwardTogether @UN @UNFPA @UNFPAIndia @MinistryWCD pic.twitter.com/B4Q12qoy5EBlue
Tigresses forward Ngangom Bala Devi was vocal about the basic human rights of
all children, especially little girls, and said that such practices have no
place in modern society.‚ÄúThe good thing in India is that we have begun the conversation of giving equal rights to women across different fields. But as long as such backward practices exist in our country, we cannot fulfil such dreams,‚Äù said Bala.‚ÄúThese are violations of basic human rights, and we need to dive deep into the misogynistic mindset and root out such perceptions. Only then will we truly be able to see equality take place in our society,‚Äù she further said.
